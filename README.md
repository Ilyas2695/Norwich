# Project made during Sync the City program hackathon. 
This is a beta version of a program that was supposed to scan a product and give a result whether it contains the selected allergens or not.
This program was made by learning React and making the program itself, using React. 
We had only 2 days to plan and build it.
Please use the program from MY last commit
